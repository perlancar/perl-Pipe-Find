=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $procs = find_pipe_processes(); # hashref, key=fd, value=process info hash

 if ($procs->{0}) {
     say "STDIN is connected to a pipe";
     say "pid=$procs->{0}{pid}";
     say "cmdline=$procs->{0}{cmdline}";
     say "exe=$procs->{0}{exe}";
 }
 if ($procs->{1}) {
     say "STDOUT is connected to a pipe";
     ...
 }
 if ($procs->{2}) {
     say "STDERR is connected to a pipe";

=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head1 FUNCTIONS

None exported by default, but they are exportable.

=head2 find_pipe_processes([ $pid ]) => \%procs

List all processes behind the pipes that your process opens. (You can also find
pipes for another process by passing its PID.)

Currently only works on Linux. Works by listing C</proc/$$/fd> and selecting all
fd's that symlinks to C<pipe:*>. Then it will list all C</proc/*/fd> and find
matching pipes.

STDIN pipe is at fd 0, STDOUT pipe at fd 1, STDERR at fd 2.

=head2 get_stdin_pipe_process() => \%procinfo

Basically a shortcut to get the fd 0 only, since this is common. Return undef if
STDIN is not piped.

If you plan on getting process information for both STDIN and STDOUT, it's
better to use C<find_pipe_processes()> than calling this function and
C<get_stdout_pipe_process()>, because the latter will scan twice.

=head2 get_stdout_pipe_process() => \%procinfo

Basically a shortcut to get the fd 1 only, since this is common. Return undef if
STDOUT is not piped.

If you plan on getting process information for both STDIN and STDOUT, it's
better to use C<find_pipe_processes()> than calling this function and
C<get_stdin_pipe_process()>, because the latter will scan twice.
